# GLOBALLY AVAILABLE OBJECTS AND METHODS IN NodeJS

1. Process => 

This is a globally available object in nodeJS , and can be accessed in any module, 
Simply write process.methodName() & you accessed process object.

But what is process actually ? Is it a module or what ?
Ans : Yes process is a module whose object is globally available according to node docs.

2. Env [Environment Variables] =>

The process core module of NodeJs , provides the env property . 
means env is a property in process object .

What is this env property ?
Ans :  It has all the environment variables which were set during any process was started . 
env variables are like { if i write USER_NAME , anywhere in my program then what it should mean :
 it will mean whatever i had assigned to it in the env file , and i will access it like  , process.env.USER_NAME }

env thing is very useful when when you have some secret keys and passwords to access an API in behalf of user in your code 
then instead of directly writing the key everywhere , simply put it in a .env file and make the file invisibe . 

As we know .env are available globally , using process module , so we need not to import that .env file everywhere 
we just have to require('dotenv') module in in JS file where we want to use env variables set . 
But still why using dotenv , can't we get it directly like we get its parent that is process & its methods 

Ans : We need to use dotenv because , that makes the file secret and all its keys also 


3. There are also many global methods : setTimeout , setInterval , etc . which can be accessed directly without any module 
even without using any object .

4. Command line arguments using process.argv --> returns an array of cmd arguments given via command line by user 
You can provide cmd line arguments like this :-
node app.js joe name=shivam

now in the array process.argv[0] = 'joe'
process.argv[1] = 'name=shivam'

Remember that we can do this while using node only not any other Runtime for JS


5. Console => 
It is the most used global module , with its method as console.log().
It prints any string provided to it , and if any object is passed to it , it will render it as a string .
there are also many methods like .clear() , .count() .
